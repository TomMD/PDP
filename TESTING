== METHOD ==
1) Test Parsing
Take assembly, assemble it, parse it, compare.

RESULTS: Things look good after the parser overhall of '98, but the assembler sucks.

2) Test Instructions
Take object code, parse it, step through it, compare interpreter results with human expectations.

RESULTS: Some instructions were wrong (ex: effectiveAddress calculation, left rotate) and some more assembler bugs popped up (ex: label address).

3) Test Programs
Take the object code of a program, run it and compare results with expectations.

REULTS:
add01 works
euler24 doesn't terminate - probably an assembler issue.
hello-world and countBinOnes works after manually fixing object code
